# OpenVPN-Installer
This is an Installer for OpenVPN which will work on Ubuntu, Debian and Centos

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in less than 4 minutes, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

###Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/v63vP -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

###I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that
You can get a little VPS at [Domains VPS](https://www.domains.co.za/aff.php?aff=1868).
